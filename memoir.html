      <p>
        “They thought they knew the story. But he lived what they only heard in whispers.”
      </p>
      <p>
        From the dusty streets of Akure to the courtrooms of London, <strong>Fathering Without Fear</strong> tells the redemptive journey of Abraham of London — a man who refused to disappear. Born a miracle. Shaped by loss. Tested by betrayal. Refined by fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        From miraculous triplet survival in 1977 Lagos to spiritual awakenings, political campaigns, and family collapse — this is not just a memoir. It’s a movement. A mirror. A map for fathers who won’t be erased.
      </p>

        “This isn’t just a memoir. It’s a declaration. A story they thought they knew — and a father they’ll never forget.”
